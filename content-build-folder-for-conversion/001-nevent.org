=Nevent= is an =EnvironmentRedirect= that notifies the changes of value of its variables. 

It is used to provide an environment for playing Synths and Patterns. The environment variables contained in it define parameters for creating Synths and Patterns.  Such parameters are:
- the =target= where a synth is created (usually a =Group=).
- the =out= or =in= parameters which designate the buses for audio or control signal input and output.
- Any other synth parameters such as =amp=, =freq=, =gate= etc.

All instances of =Nevent= are created at once during StartUp, and are stored in an Array in classvar =all=.  This ensures that the order of Nevent instances is fixed.
