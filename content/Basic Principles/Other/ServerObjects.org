* Server
Each =Nevent= Environment has  only one Server instance.  Synths and Patterns play in that instance.

Open issue: Where to store the server of an Environment.  Possibilities: 

1. As variable =~server=
2. In Library using Registry, using =[environment \server]= as key
3. Do not store, use =Server.default=
