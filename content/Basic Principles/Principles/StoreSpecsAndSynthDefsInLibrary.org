#+TITLE: Store Specs and SynthDefs in Library
#+CATEGORIES: notes
#+TAGS: TODO, design

Specs and SynthDefs should be stored in Library using Registry.  Advantages: 

- simplify and unify the API for accessing Specs and SynthDefs (and SynthDescs).
- provide global access to Specs and SynthDefs for all environments, guis, synths using spec/synthdef name.
- ensure SynthDefs are always loaded when the server is rebooted, also when it is a remote server.
- provide easy global access to SynthDescs for automatic GUI generation.
