* Work in progress - August 2017

- Dispatch class for use in Nevent
- Rework of Group allocation scheme
- New class: Player for playing Synths and Patterns in the same instance.

* Future plans: Audio Feedback between synths

A particularly interesting case is when an Ndef reads and processes its own output.  An implementation of this feature, using [[http://doc.sccode.org/Classes/InFeedback.html][InFeedback]] is planned for the future.
