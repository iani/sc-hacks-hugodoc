Initially, /sc-hacks/ was motivated by the need to improve some aspects [[http://doc.sccode.org/Overviews/JITLib.html][JITLib]], such as:

- The use of signal-copying synths to audio busses for linking i/o between synths.
- The modification of patterns while they are being played with Pbind.

Fascinated by the => operator of [[http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/doc/language/][ChucK]], and by the idea of [[http://doc.sccode.org/Reference/Adverbs.html][adverbs for binary operators]] in SuperCollider, I wanted to explore binary operators as a way to write commonly used expressions in a shorter way.  

The first results of these attempts are the libraries [[tiny-sc]] and [[tiny-inc]].  These have many shortcomings, which the present library is trying to fix.  At present, /sc-hacks/ is being redesigned once more, in order to implement two of the most attractive features of JITLib: sequential playing synth-functions and patterns in one =Ndef= and linking the output of an Ndef to the input of another Ndef.
