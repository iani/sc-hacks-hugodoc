*As of August 2017, sc-hacks is being re-done from scratch.
Both the library and its API will change in the near future.*

The purpose of the /sc-hacks/ library is to make experimentation and music making in SuperCollider easier, by offering simpler and shorter coding options for tasks that usually require complex and careful coding. Such are:

- Replace one synth with another seamlessly while playing
- Freely change the contents of patterns while playing
- Set the parameters of synths either by setting environment variables or through a gui
- Link outputs and inputs of synths and place them in the right order to filter the output of a synth with another synth
- Manage sets of code files to be loaded at startup, and of audio files to be loaded when the server boots
- Map the control signal of synth functions or envelopes to the parameters of a synth.

* Caveat

/sc-hacks/ is in *permanent alpha*.  As it says in http://semver.org/, /"If youâ€™re changing the API every day you should either still be in version 0.y.z or on a separate development branch working on the next major version."/.  This library will remain 0.n alpha for a long time, as changes in operator names and syntax are happening constantly.
